# Python Crash Course 2023

A super speedy introduction/refresh course of Python basics - intended for the Induction Week for the Applied Mathematics MSc. 

The course will be held on Tuesday, October 3rd by [Sara Bicego](https://sites.google.com/view/s-bicego/home). 

The course will be an interactive hands-on exercise session, covering Python 3 basics, including algebra for vectors/matrices and how to solve linear/nonlinear systems of equations. The material will be uploaded here. This page will be subject to changes.

## Before the course - Installing Anaconda
Before the course, you will need your laptop to be set up with Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook. Anaconda is an useful package that allows for an easy start into the world of Python. Here you can find instructions for installing what you will need on your machine via the Anaconda platform. 

Installing Anaconda will equip your laptop with the Python interpreter, a number of useful Python packages (matplotlib, NumPy, SciPy, etc.), 
Jupyter Notebook, and the conda package manager. Note that installing Python via Anaconda will not break any other installations of Python that already exist on your computer. 

Without farther ado, here comes the action!
1. Navigate to [this page](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and download the software according with your machine requirements.
2. After the download is complete, begin the installation process.

More detailed instruction for installation can be found [here](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module1_GettingStartedWithPython/Installing_Python.html#:~:text=Installing%20the%20Anaconda%20platform%20will,matplotlib%2C%20NumPy%2C%20and%20SciPy.).
Lastly, if you are more of a visual learner, here is the [link to a video](https://learning.anaconda.cloud/get-started-with-anaconda?next=%2Fget-started-with-anaconda%2F18199) covering the installation process and some additional material.

For any questions do not hesitate to contact me - otherwise, see you in October! 

## The course
The lecture will take place in the lab room 414 (Huxley Building) on Tuesday October the 3^{rd} from 9am to 1pm. The program is divided into a first and a second part, with a short break in between. 

* [Part 1](https://github.com/jadgle/PyCrashCourse2023/blob/8048447c196c3a0c435a9bcf95bcfb49264fd4c7/Part_1.ipynb) - In the first part of the course we will be covering the Python basics, starting from "Hello World" and the variable definition, up to data structures like strings and lists. We will also introduce the basic constructs (if/for/while) and list comprehensions.
* [Part 2](https://github.com/jadgle/PyCrashCourse2023/blob/6da3f02fa20d3ea2b863d4473d55aa22596c7dd3/Part_2.ipynb) - In the second part of the course we will be working with matrices and numpy arrays and solving systems of linear and non-linear equations using this data structure. This will be followed by a brief introduction to Matplotlib.
